# Traffic Sign Classification

This simple Python application uses the Tkinter GUI library and a trained deep learning model to classify traffic signs. The model is loaded from the 'model/model.h5' file, and it can predict the class of a traffic sign when an image is uploaded.

If you need the complete Jupyter file, please wait cuz I just clicked the wrong "Train" :)))

Feel free to customize the script and integrate it into your projects!
